  "description": "A burger logging app built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM following the MVC design pattern. Node and MySQL are used to query and route the data into the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.  Users input the names of burgers they want to eat and when the name is submitted, the burger displays on the left side of the page in the waiting area. The Devour it! button, when clicked, moves the burger to the right side of the page. Every burger, whether devoured or not is saved in a database.",
